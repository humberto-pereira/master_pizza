- The Master Pizza Manager App is a comprehensive pizza sales and costs management tool designed for pizzerias. This app allows the user to effectively track pizza sales, ingredient stock, ingredient costs, and the costs associated with producing individual types of pizzas. It also provides a dynamic pizza selling price recommendation based on the cost of production and a desired profit margin.

- Key Features:
Pizza Sales Tracking: The app tracks the number of each type of pizza sold, and keeps this information updated in a 'pizza sales' worksheet.

- Ingredient Stock Management: The app allows users to keep track of the amount of ingredients left in stock, updating this information in an 'ingredients stock' worksheet.

- Ingredient Costs: The app tracks the cost of each ingredient per kilogram in an 'ingredients kg prices' worksheet.

- Pizza Cost Calculation: For each type of pizza, the app calculates the cost of production based on the ingredients used and the cost per kilogram of each ingredient. This information is stored in a 'pizza cost' worksheet.

- Pizza Price Recommendation: The app provides a dynamic selling price recommendation for each type of pizza. This is calculated by adding a fixed cost per pizza (determined by the pizzeria's fixed costs divided by the number of pizzas sold on the last market day) and a 35% profit margin to the cost of each pizza. This information is updated in a 'pizza selling price' worksheet.

- Profit Calculation: The app calculates the profit for each type of pizza by subtracting the cost from the selling price, and stores this data in a 'profit' worksheet.

- Reporting: The app generates comprehensive reports, providing the user with a clear overview of their pizza business. It can display reports on pizza sales, ingredient stock, ingredient costs, pizza costs, recommended selling prices, and profit.

- Automated Worksheet Updating: The app can automatically send updated data to the relevant worksheets, keeping all records up-to-date.

- In conclusion, the Master Pizza Manager App is a powerful tool that simplifies pizza sales and cost management, allowing pizzerias to effectively monitor their operations, reduce waste, and maximize profit.
